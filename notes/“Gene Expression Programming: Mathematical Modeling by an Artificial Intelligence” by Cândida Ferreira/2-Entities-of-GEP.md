# The Entities of Gene Expression Programming 

GEP gene expression is simple. The main players are only two: The chromosomes and the expression trees. The latteer consisting of the expression of the genetic information encoded in the former 

- The process of information decoding is called translation 
- This translation implies a kind of code and a set of rules
    - This code is very simple, with one to one relationship between symbols of the chromosome and the cuntions and terminals they represent
    - Rules are also simple, they determine the spatial organization of the functions and terminals in the expression trees and the type of interaction between sub-expression trees in multigenic systems
-  This means there are two languages in GEP
    - Language of the genes
    - Language of the expression trees  
- Thanks to the simple rules that determine structure of expression trees and their interactions, it is possible to infer immediately the phenotype (equivalent to folding of a protein) given the sequence of a gene and vice versa
-  Called *Karva* language
