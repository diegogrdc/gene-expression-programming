# Notes on “Gene Expression Programming: Mathematical Modeling by an Artificial Intelligence” by Cândida Ferreira


## Introduction : The Biological Perspective

This chapter goes through the differences of Gene Expression Programming (GEP) to its predecessors, Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Genetic Programming (GP). 

- All these algorithms use a population of individuals, select through fitness, and do genetic variation. 
- The difference resides on the nature of individuals
